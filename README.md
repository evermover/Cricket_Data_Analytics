It provides an interactive and visually appealing representation of the top performers, allowing users to analyze and explore the data easily.

## Data Source

The data used in this visualization is sourced from T20 Cricket World Cups. It includes player names, statistics, and other relevant information. The data is organized in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or CSV) or a database.

## Power BI Report

The Power BI report contains the following components:

1. Visualizations: The report includes various visualizations to showcase the top 11 players. 

2. Player Attributes: The report displays player attributes such as Player Name, Runs Scored, Batting Average, Strike Rate, Wickets, Bowling Average, and
any other relevant statistics. These attributes are used to determine the top performers.

3. Aggregation and Sorting: The report calculates summary statistics based on the player data using aggregation functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, or MAX.
Players are sorted based on the selected criteria, such as the number of runs scored, highest batting average, or most wickets taken.

4. Top 11 Selection: The visualization is limited to display only the top 11 players. Filters or visual-level filters are applied to ensure that only the top performers are shown.

5. Customization and Enhancements: The report's appearance is customizable to improve readability and aesthetics. You can modify font styles, colors, labels, and other visual elements according to your preferences. Additional elements like titles, legends, and data labels can be added to provide context and aid understanding.
